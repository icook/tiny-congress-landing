    <h1>Tiny Congress</h1>
    <p class="headline">Trusted communication at internet scale.</p>
    <p class="subheadline">Open infrastructure for identity, reputation, and large-scale consensus.</p>
    <p class="intro">The internet is great at broadcasting opinions, but terrible at expressing trust. TinyCongress is an open-source project to help people understand who they're hearing from, why they should trust them, and where genuine consensus exists.</p>

  <section id="whats-broken">
    <h2><span class="section-num">1.</span> What's broken</h2>
    <ul class="problem-list">
      <li><strong>Identity without trust signals.</strong> Anonymous speech dominates important conversations.</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement without consensus.</strong> Platforms optimize outrage for profit, not understanding.</li>
      <li><strong>Centralized incentives.</strong> Ad-driven systems reward noise over clarity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="aside">We don't need more speech. We need better signal.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vision">
    <h2><span class="section-num">2.</span> The vision</h2>
    <p class="section-tagline">A different model for mass communication</p>
    <p>TinyCongress explores how trusted identity and explicit reputation can enable large groups to communicate honestly, discover agreement, and disagree productively.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opinions are signed, not anonymous.</li>
      <li>Trust is personal, contextual, and explicit.</li>
      <li>Consensus is measured, not inferred by engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="aside">This is infrastructure, not a social network.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="the-model">
    <h2><span class="section-num">3.</span> The model</h2>
    <p class="section-tagline">A public utility, not a platform</p>
    <p>TinyCongress aspires to follow the model of projects like Let's Encrypt: free, open-source infrastructure operated in the public interest. No ads. No engagement metrics. Funded by donations and sponsorships to keep incentives aligned with usefulness, not addiction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open source by default.</li>
      <li>Neutral base layer.</li>
      <li>Designed to be boring, reliable, and cheap to operate.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="the-project">
    <h2><span class="section-num">4.</span> The project</h2>
    <p class="section-tagline">Two components</p>

    <h3>Identity and reputation base layer</h3>
    <p>A cryptographic identity system where people can make signed attestations about trust, security posture, and reputation across multiple dimensions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device-based keys</li>
      <li>Explicit endorsements and denouncements</li>
      <li>Personal trust graphs, not global scores</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A communication demo</h3>
    <p>An experimental interface that shows what becomes possible when trust and identity are first-class primitives.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured polling instead of comment threads</li>
      <li>Consensus discovery at scale</li>
      <li>Views filtered by who you trust</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="what-this-is-not">
    <h2><span class="section-num">5.</span> What this is not</h2>
    <ul class="not-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Not a social credit system.</strong>
        Trust is personal and contextual. Your view of someone's reputation is yours alone. There's no global score, no public ranking, no consequences enforced by the system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Not a replacement for elections.</strong>
        This is infrastructure for communication and consensus discovery, not governance. It might help groups understand where they agree, but it doesn't make decisions for them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Not an algorithmic truth machine.</strong>
        The system doesn't decide what's true. It helps you see who said what, who trusts whom, and where agreement exists. The interpretation is still yours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Not optimized for growth or engagement.</strong>
        No metrics that reward time-on-site, no viral loops, no dark patterns. Success is measured by usefulness, not addiction.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section id="status">
    <h2><span class="section-num">6.</span> Status</h2>
    <p>This is a passion project, built by one person in a garage on nights and weekends. I’m aiming to have a preview alpha ready sometime in Q1 2026.</p>

    <p>TinyCongress is in early development. If this resonates, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
